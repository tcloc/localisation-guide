# A Guide to Creating Localisation-Friendly User Interfaces

[This guide](https://github.com/tcloc/localisation-guide/wiki/Localisation-Guide) was created by a group of students studying for a masterâ€™s degree in Technical Communication and Localisation at the University of Strasbourg in France.

The aim of the guide is to assist IT developers and designers in creating user interfaces (UIs) that are optimised for localisation. It addresses software interfaces in general rather than for a specific genre such as gaming.

Localisation specialists are faced with many challenges when translating or preparing UIs for localisation. UI strings that are ambiguous, inconsistent or lacking context may result in poorly localised software. This can compromise user experience and result in a UI that is messy and difficult to use. We believe that such challenges can be overcome by providing IT developers and designers with a clear set of instructions to generate localisation-friendly UI text or copy.

UI texts that are optimised for localisation will also positively impact the overall quality and efficiency of the software and make it more user-friendly, as well as reduce the number of support tickets. Comprehensible UI texts also form the basis of good documentation and its translation.

As part of the research for this guide, localisation professionals were invited to participate in a survey. Their experiences in localising UIs, including issues that they face, together with their recommendations to overcome these issues have been instrumental in creating the content for this guide.

We hope that you find this guide useful in your work as a UI developer or designer.
